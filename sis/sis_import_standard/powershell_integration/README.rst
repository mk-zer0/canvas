This script makes use of the invoke-RestMethod which is only present in PowerShell v3. If
you do not have PowerShell v3, you can get it from
http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=34595.

Also it uses a added powershell cmdlet called "Powershell Community Extensions" PSCX
3.0.0.0. You will need to download the msi file from
https://github.com/Pscx/Pscx Then run the msi installer. You may need to
reboot the machine in order for the environment variable paths to take.
