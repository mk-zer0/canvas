# Show Report a Problem Help Link To Only Teachers and Admins
Confirmed working as of Sept 22, 2016 in Google Chrome on OSX.

Important: Both the javascript and CSS are needed for this to function if you want the option to appears for teachers and admins.

This script/CSS shows the "Report a Problem" option on the global navigation Help menu only to teachers and admins in the web UI. The option si NOT hidden in the app. If you would like to hide this option for everyone then you should use the Help links feature in Canvas to remove the Report a Problem link (https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-7280).

**Note**: As with any part of Canvas, the links that the CSS rules and Javascript code target could change at any time. Be sure to check your beta environment before each production release to be sure that this code has not broken due to changes in Canvas with each production release or other release.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind.
Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the
community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this
documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
