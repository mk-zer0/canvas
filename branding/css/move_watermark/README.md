# Move the watermark on a Canvas page

This is a very simple CSS script that allows the watermark to be moved by it's margins. Feel free to edit and use as you'd like. The watermark can be difficult to target and future UI changes may cause this to fail.

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in mind.
Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this. That said, the
community will hopefully help support and keep both the script and this
documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
